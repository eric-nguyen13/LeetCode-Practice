# LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my Leet Code Repository! Here, you'll find most of my documents relating to Leet Code Practice! I've been independently studying to become a better software developer by leveraging Leet Code Questions, Cracking the Coding Interview, and many side projects.

In hopes of a Summer 2024 Software Development internship, I will be utilizing **LeetHub**, a free Google Extension that automatically pushes your solutions to GitHub upon completion of a question's testcases. I wish I knew about this tool sooner, because I've done many questions already.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions! I hope you enjoy my progress through LeetCode!
